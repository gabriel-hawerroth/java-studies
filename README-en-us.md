    1. How do you validate two conditions in a YAML file when creating a bean?

    2. How would you diagnose and resolve performance issues in a high-load Spring Boot app?

    3. What steps would you take to scale a Spring Boot app for increased traffic?

    4. How do transactions work with @Transactional, and what happens internally?

    5. How can you deploy a cost-effective Spring Boot app with pay-per-use server resources?

    6. How would you handle multiple beans of the same type?

    7. How do you prevent a dependency from being auto-configured in Spring Boot?

    8. How can you log request details (URL, HTTP method, body) before a controller processes them?

    9. How do you log execution times for @Transactional methods?

    10. How would you implement role-based access control and method-level security?
